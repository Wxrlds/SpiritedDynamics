![Spirited Dynamics Overview](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/Spirited_Dynamics/BH_SD_HEADER.png)

<center>
It's only the void, some grass, a patch of water, a growing tree, and a little light.</br>
You're trapped there.</br>
No way out although you somehow managed to get in there.</br>
Time exists but the star you're orbiting doesn't move but it still starts to rain.</br>
It is confusing.</br>
You dance around the tree, it grows, you start expanding your platform, and discover a botanical way that generates ores.</br>
The three dimensions seem empty.</br>
What happened here?</br>
You start experimenting, dissolve materials into their elements.</br>
You think that you can harness energy out of the dark sky but you have to find a way to move that star out of the way.</br>
Eventually you become desperate, you start pouring your blood over stones, something happened but doing this hurts.</br>
Your body stopped healing itself, you need to find another way to regenerate.</br>
Those blue trees that you created seem to have item transportation abilities.

Use Antimatter, the power of the stars to reach Alfheim and harvest their resources to make the Meka-Suit?

Contains a custom advancements tab to help you a little.

To play Spirited Dynamics it's recommended that you allocate 6GB of RAM, but 4GB should be sufficient due to the low number of mods
